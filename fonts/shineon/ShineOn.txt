"ShineOn" is the 27th new free font from DarkSide Productions.
It was completed on 02/10/99 and is a conditionally* FREE font!

*Conditionally free means free for everyone, for either personal or
commercial use. The only stipulation: If you plan to include this font
on a disk or CD, as part of any software, collection or library,
whether on diskette medium or digitally on the web, for distribution
to the public on either a "for profit" or "not for profit" basis,
permission must be obtained in writing from the author and copyright
holder, who is specifically identified as:

R. Gast

It may be distributed as a free font as long as this text file
(ShineOn.txt) is included with it. "If it's free," you ask, 
"why keep this file with the font?"

Here's the reason: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using this
font in some manner. And if you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!

The character set includes:

All Upper and Lower case letters and numbers.
The vast majority of punctuation and international characters.

The name "ShineOn" was the result of my first "Name That Font" contest.
I just couldn't come up with a name that I liked, so I sent a GIF
sample of the font via e-mail to a number of my friends, and the
winner received a free copy of Palladium's "Ultimate Scrapbook
Creator", the first software to include some of DarkSide's Free Fonts
as part of the program.  ShineOn contained both a reference to Pink
Floyd (DarkSide's Fave) and the word "neOn" in reference to the "neon
light"-like appearance of the characters.

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
do want to make a donation to encourage me to continue my creative
efforts, send it to the address above. (Yeah....As If!) Thanks & Enjoy!
